                <br> <br>
                We help you design your marketing strategy considering the marketing mix - also known as the “4 P's of marketing”.
                <br> <br>
                You may ask which “P” in the marketing mix is the most essential, but let me tell you that each one is important in its way. You can ignore Product-price-place and promotion while designing the distribution planning and selecting the distribution channel. Distribution channels are the methods by which companies deliver products and services to customers and end-users.
                <br> <br>
                Some businesses sell directly to their customers, while others might use a retailer or wholesaler to serve as an intermediary.
